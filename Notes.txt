Compare a boolean with another value
In JavaScript, null equals undefined
If either value is NaN, then the equal operator(==) returns false
The not-equal (!=) operator returns true when comparing the NaN with another value
The strict equal and not strict equal operators behave like the equal and not equal operators except that they donâ€™t convert the operand before comparison.

[Objects]there's one really useful thing that bracket notation has but is not available in the dot notation: It can evaluate expressions.
Arrays are Objects
.concat() method
To read each individual character at a specific index in a string, starting from zero, I can use the charAt() method
The indexOf returns the location of the first position that matches a character
The lastIndexOf finds the last match, otherwise it works the same as indexOf.
The split method chops up the string into an array of sub-strings
toUpperCase() toLowerCase() 
Assigning a function as a method of an object
using typeof()--- array,function can also be passed as a parameter
Bugs and errors
Main types of errors : Range, Syntax, Type, and Reference
try and catch used to continue execution after an error

Empty : " " ' '
null : represents intentional absence of object value
