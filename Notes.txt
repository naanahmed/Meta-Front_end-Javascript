JQUERY became the most important Javascript library for a decade because it solved the problem interoperability on different browsers
REACT why popular : CRUD complex websites
Automatic Semi colon insertion
%C
Undefined | Null | Boolean | String | Number | ES6  (BigInt | Symbol)
**
Strings cant break on to the next line
Delimiters
== and ===
coercion when adding strings and numbers
if else is well suited bor binary choices
%c convert your arguments to css
comparison of strings
toString and valueOf methods //important
Compare a boolean with another value
In JavaScript, null equals undefined
If either value is NaN, then the equal operator(==) returns false
The not-equal (!=) operator returns true when comparing the NaN with another value
The strict equal and not strict equal operators behave like the equal and not equal operators except that they donâ€™t convert the operand before comparison.
Truthy and falsy
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands
[Objects]there's one really useful thing that bracket notation has but is not available in the dot notation: It can evaluate expressions.
Arrays are Objects
.concat() method
To read each individual character at a specific index in a string, starting from zero, I can use the charAt() method
The indexOf returns the location of the first position that matches a character
The lastIndexOf finds the last match, otherwise it works the same as indexOf.
The split method chops up the string into an array of sub-strings
toUpperCase() toLowerCase() 
Assigning a function as a method of an object
using typeof()--- array,function can also be passed as a parameter
Bugs and errors
Main types of errors : Range, Syntax, Type, and Reference
try and catch used to continue execution after an error
undefined : in functions when it returns nthg (just displays), when a variable is not assigned a value, object property that doesnot exist
Empty : " " ' '
null : represents intentional absence of object value
We can use return values from one function inside another function.
JavaScript functions are truly first-class citizens, which can be assigned to variable names and passed around just like I would pass around a string, a number, an object, etc.
A higher-order function is a function that accepts other functions as arguments or returns functions when invoked (or both)
A pure function returns the exact same result as long as it's given the same values. 
For a function to be considered pure is that it should not have side-effects. A side-effect is any instance where a function makes a change outside of itself.
Declared with var : 1. can be used before declaration, 2. can be redeclared 3. can be scoped to a function or globally
Declared with let and const : 1. cant be used before delaration 2. cant be redeclared (in let can be reassigned) 3. scoped to block 4. const must be initialized (no access before initialization), cant be reassigned
